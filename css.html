    <h1>CARSCARDIAN STYLE SHEETS (CSS)</h1>
    <p>CSS is a tool or library that is used to design, style and add beauty to a webpage.</p>
    <p>CSS is used by web developers by targeting the different tags of HTML. There are mainly
        two ways of inserting CSS into our webpages.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">By using inline method:</li>
        <p>Here, CSS is used in such a way that the styles are put directly in the HTML tag 
            using the style attribute. We then define what we want to insert.
        </p>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">By using external css files:</li>
        <p>Here, a CSS file is created and the styling of the different HTML tags is done in that external file.
            What we do here is that, all the different tags are given classes and the class is targeted using a "." for example, if the h2 tag is given
            a class of heading, to target it in the external css file, we use the ".heading" to target it.
        </p>
        <p>There are some different tags we use to target HTML tags as mentioned below:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Using a universal selector:</li>
            <p>Here, we use the * sign to select everything in our pages. It is usuakky used to give 
                our pages margins and specify the paddings.
            </p>
            <li>Using the . sign:</li>
            <p>The . sign, as mentioned above is used for targeting classes of HTML tags. It is used when one whats 
                to design and style content in a given HTML tag only, without interfering with the rest of the content
                elsewhere.
            </p>
            <li>Using the # selector:</li>
            <p>The # sign is used to target the id of the HTML tag. An HTML tag is given an id an using the # sign, we can easily
                select it an style it. This one is used often when we want to style diffent elements diffently but are nested under 
                the same div element.
            </p>
